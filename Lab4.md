zfs/Additional Resources relative URL targets now invalid in Redirect
So I choose to delete the link in the document.

It is important to maintain a good documentation because a good documentation will make people have a good code quality.
And the good code quality will also contribute to good documentation. The project will be much better by a good documentation.

1. Better document will be easier for people to join the project.
2. Bttter document will help people to repair code.

The most important thing I learn from this lab is that before I don't think there will be so many mistakes in Document of 
FreeBSD, such a big project, but there certainly are many mistakes in their document.
