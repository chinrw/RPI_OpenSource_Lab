2. We need to choose a license because we need to figure out what rule our software should follow. With particular license, we could have a outline for our programming and this also can help us if we have conflictwith other software.

3. Without an explicit license, if this project has a great effects, users will not use the software as what the programmer wanted. They may use the software not as what programmers would like.

4. I agree with this claim. The Gopher is not as great as web in hypertext, and its menu system has a much more poorly document performance than web. As author said in article “This system is so versatile and configurable that the only boundary is the author's imagination”.

5. Why linux choose GPL v2? First of all, the author, linus, agree with that this software is a kind of free software and also he does not like the term about anti-tivoization in GPL v3, so he doesn't change to GPL v3. And also many contributions to linux are licensed in v2 so it will be illegal to release the linux on v3 with these contributions.

7. I think apache is good for company because compare with GPL, people who use software which include apache doesn’t need release their source code after they modifying source code. And this action which people need to release their source code after modify is required by GPL. So GPL is good for developers because it protects developers profit. The following modify has to be release. LGPL is good for common good because company can easily use software by LGPL and don’t need to release their source code and LGPL is not good for second develop on software which use LGPL because the modify code still need to use LGPL so this is good for developer and company.

8. I would like to working on a web application or an android application which can monitor the status of my server and do some actions such as restart server or clean cache. First of all, find software which can collect information of server and then analyze these data in order to help make graph. After that, push these data to client, in the client the application will use the data to make graph. This application will help administrator to maintain their servers. They can check the status and daemon in servers by cell phone not need to use computer. I will choose Apache License.
